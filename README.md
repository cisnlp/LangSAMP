# LangSAMP

This is the repository for **LangSAMP** (Language-Script Aware Multilingual Pretraining), a method that incorporates both **language** and **script** embeddings to enhance representation learning while maintaining a simple architecture. Specifically, we integrate these embeddings into the output of the transformer blocks before passing the final representations to the language modeling head for prediction. Our pretraining ease the burden of encoding language-specific information in token embeddings, thus improving their language neutrality, which is beneficial for crosslingual transfer.

## Continued Pretraining

We use the [Glot500-c](https://github.com/cisnlp/Glot500) corpus for continued-pretraining our models. The dataset contains more than 500 languages.

To continued-pretrain the model, run:

```
bash run_mlm.sh
```

You can change the .sh files for specifying ```--use_lang_embedding``` for using language embeddings or ```--use_script_embedding``` for using script embeddings. ```full_dicts.pkl``` is a pickle file contains the dictionaries mapping language codes ISO-639-3 to integers (starting from 0) and script codes to integers (starting from 0), which are required to initialize the language embeddings and script embeddings.
